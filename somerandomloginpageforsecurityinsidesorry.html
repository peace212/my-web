								<h3>Dear Chhotu</h3>
								I just want to hold you in my arms and never let you go. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, you are my life. I am so sorry, so embarrassed, so disappointed in myself, I feel sick inside.<br><br>
	Today I lost it completely, and I need to have a good look at myself. I have no excuse, I need to wake up and act like the man that I am.
	I love you, and I know that you really need my support at the moment, instead I've let you down and and hurt you badly.
	<br><br>Babe I have been feeling stressed out lately with whatever has happened in the past week,all wrong thoughts came to my mind and I completely lost myself but deep
	down inside	I just want to see you happy, I never meant to hurt you.

	I understand you don't want to talk to me now, I don't blame you one bit. I don't know if I can change your mind, I can only prove to you that I'll make a better person ,one who deserves you by showing it, not talking about it, actions speak louder than words.

	<br><br>Today is the first day of the rest of my life, I really needed a wake up call and I got one. I'm writing this letter to you to apologise and I'm writing this from the bottom of my heart. I'm sorry and I still want to be with you forever, but I need to prove to you that I'm worthy, and worthy I know I am.

	<br><br>I'm sorry that I hurt you, you have shown me nothing but love and patience. I love you more than you know, but it's up to me to prove it. As I said, actions speak louder than words, so let my actions prove my love for you.

	<br><br>Please forgive me.

	<br><br>Yours
	<br>.....
